Komposter
=========

Komposter is a lightweight music composing system intended mainly to be used in applications where the size of the executable must be minimized such as 4K and 64K intros.

It is built using a modular "virtual analog" model, where the composer can build the synthesizers from scratch using simple basic building blocks. This minimizes the amount of code required and relies more on data, which can be compressed more effectively.

A simple pattern-based sequencer is used to create songs which use up to 24 voices, each of which can use a different synthesizer. Each synthesizer can be programmed with a number of patches that can be switched between patterns.

Included with Komposter is a music player with full x86 assembly source code as well as a converter for generating nasm-includeable files from song files. Source code for the converter is also provided.

As Komposter is still in beta stage, please give me feedback on any bugs you may encounter or features you'd like to see added. Bugs and crashes are very likely, so please save your work often.
